Part I: Signal Management
============================================================================
trace01: send SIGINT with no foreground process
trace02: send SIGTSTP with no foreground process
trace03: send SIGQUIT with no foreground process
trace04: send SIGINT to foreground job
trace05: send SIGINT to every process in foreground job
trace06: send SIGTSTP to foreground job
trace07: send SIGTSTP to every process in foreground job
trace08: send SIGQUIT to foreground job
trace09: send SIGQUIT to every process in foreground job

Part II: Multiple Jobs
============================================================================
trace10: run a job in the background
trace11: run multiple, but not all, jobs in the background
trace12: background jobs print JID and PID
trace13: background jobs added to jobs list
trace14: send SIGINT only to foreground job
trace15: send SIGTSTP only to foreground job
trace16: send SIGQUIT only to foreground job

Part III: Reaping
============================================================================
trace17: single background job is reaped
trace18: background jobs are reaped in a loop
trace19: print change in state for jobs suspended in foreground
trace20: print change in state and clean up jobs
         terminated by a signal in background
trace21: print change in state for jobs suspended in background
trace22: print change in state for jobs terminated by a signal in foreground
trace23: print change in state for jobs resumed in the background
trace24: print exit status for background jobs
trace25: print proper signal that terminates a job
trace26: print proper signal that stops a job
trace27: jobs finishing in the foreground never appear in the jobs list
trace28: jobs finishing in the background are removed from the jobs list
trace29: jobs terminated by a signal in the foreground
         do not appear in the list
trace30: jobs terminated by a signal in the background
         are removed from the jobs list
trace31: jobs suspended in the foreground are added
         to the jobs list as stopped
trace32: jobs suspended in the background are updated in the jobs list
trace33: jobs resumed in the background are updated as running
trace34: triggers a bug where the return value of waitpid is not checked

Part IV: bg and fg
============================================================================
trace35: simple bg test
trace36: bg resumes only the target job
trace37: bg restarts all processes in a job
trace38: simple fg test
trace39: fg resumes only target job
trace40: fg restarts all processes in a job
trace41: waitpid after fg prints message if terminated by a signal
trace42: waitpid after fg uses WUNTRACED and prints suspended message
